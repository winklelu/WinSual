My old laptop had a strange problem. Even after a professional repair, it kept shutting down by itself. For someone who works with data every day, this was too risky to ignore. So I decided to get a new computer.

This was also a good chance to rename my personal website from Winkode to **WinSual**, and rebuild my development environment from scratch.

## What I Did Tonight

When I moved my files to the new MacBook, the files came over — but the tools did not. Here is what I had to check:

- **Git**: Already built into macOS. Just run `git --version` to confirm.
- **R, Python, and project folders**: Moved over fine and worked without problems.
- **Quarto**: Not included in the move. I downloaded it from the official website and installed it in about five minutes.

## Things That Went Wrong

The most surprising problem was a folder name. My R folder was saved with a **full-width "Ｒ"** — a character from the Chinese input method — instead of a normal English "R". Terminal could not find the path at all. It took a while to figure out why. Renaming the folder to a regular English letter fixed it right away.

Another thing: R packages do not move to a new computer automatically. When I ran `quarto render`, it showed an error saying `tidyverse` was missing. After installing it, everything worked. If other blog posts use different packages, I will need to install those too.

For GitHub login, passwords are no longer supported. You must use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead. Once you set it up, Mac's osxkeychain saves it for you, so you do not need to enter it every time you push.

## Don't Forget to Sync GitHub on a New Machine

This is easy to forget. On a new computer, your local Git history is empty. You need to connect it to GitHub again:

1. `git init` — set up a new local repo
2. `git remote add origin` — link it to your GitHub repo
3. First `git push` needs `--force` — because your local repo has no history yet, GitHub will block a normal push

After that, everything is back to normal. Just use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` each time you make changes. See the diagram below:

## Final Thoughts

WinSual is now live 👉 <https://winklelu.github.io/WinSual/>

The direction is clear — turning complex data into something people can actually understand. That is what I will keep doing.
