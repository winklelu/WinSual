🎯 **ggplot2 & Data Visualization Design**

Based on _"Data Visualization in R Using ggplot2 & Friends"_ by **Statistics Globe / Joachim Schork** and _"Fundamentals of Data Visualization"_ by **Claus O. Wilke**,  
I embarked on a **30-day data visualization challenge** — a journey that gradually shifted my focus from *technical plotting* to *visual thinking*.

This challenge was part of the **2025 iThome Ironman Competition in Taiwan**,  
where participants commit to publishing one IT-related article every day for 30 consecutive days.  
You can view my full series here: [iThome Ironman Challenge – 30 Days of ggplot2](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/users/20177964/ironman/8340?page=3).

My process followed a simple rhythm:

> **read → practice → share**

This rhythm turned out to be one of the most effective ways to internalize new skills and transform passive knowledge into creative output. Every day, I learned something new about how data could be shaped, expressed, and communicated visually.

## 🧩 The Grammar of Graphics Mindset

At its core, **ggplot2** embodies the _Grammar of Graphics_ — a philosophy of building visualizations through syntax, layer by layer.

It reminds me of **SAS PROC SGPLOT** and **TEMPLATE**:  
both rely on *layered composition*, where each layer is independent yet harmonized.  

Connecting data to visuals is not merely about stacking code —  
it’s about understanding how **data structure** meets **visual semantics**.

Through exploring the philosophy of `aes()` and the logic behind each `geom_xx()` layer,  
I came to realize that **data visualization is not just a skill — it’s a way of thinking.**

Throughout the series, I used real-world open datasets — from **Taiwan’s energy, postal, and demographic data**, to built-in R datasets — making each example grounded, contextual, and relatable.

## 🌈 Extensions and ggplot2 4.0.0 Highlights

Beyond the classic chart types (scatter, density, boxplot, heatmap, line chart, etc.),  
I explored several extensions that greatly expand ggplot2’s expressive power:

- **ggrepel** — for non-overlapping labels  
- **ggpointdensity** — for high-density scatter plots  
- **ggstatsplot** — for integrated statistical testing  
- **patchwork** — for elegant multi-plot layouts  

One major highlight during the challenge was the release of **ggplot2 4.0.0**,  
which marked a significant evolution in the package’s design and structure.  
Here are some key updates from the [official announcement](https://lnkd.in/gRZW54DQ):

1️⃣ **Transition from S3 to S7** object system — offering stricter type validation and more flexibility for developers.  
2️⃣ **Theme system overhaul** — introducing _ink/paper/accent_ logic and new helpers like `theme_sub_axis()`.  
3️⃣ **Integration of palettes and scales into themes** — ensuring consistent and harmonious visual design across plots.

These updates reflect how ggplot2 continues to balance **stability** and **innovation**, remaining one of the most elegant tools in the R ecosystem.

## 🎨 Balancing Color and Design

As **Cara Thompson** mentioned at *Shiny in Production 2023*,  
the goal of visualization isn’t simply to *make it pretty*, but to make it **instantly understandable**.

Color choices, typography, and text hierarchy all serve a purpose —  
to guide the reader’s eye, emphasize the story, and support comprehension.

> Clarity is not a constraint — it’s an act of design.

Throughout this challenge, I found myself constantly adjusting palettes and contrasts,  
balancing scientific precision with aesthetic intuition.

## ✨ Personal Reflection

This 30-day journey reminded me that **data visualization lives at the intersection of science and art**.  
Accuracy ensures integrity, but aesthetics guide attention and memory.

A great visualization doesn’t just display information —  
it **tells a story**, **connects people**, and **makes insights memorable**.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the **R community**, the **iThome Ironman platform**,  
and all mentors who make learning, sharing, and creating so much more accessible and inspiring.  
Their openness is what makes this journey truly rewarding.
